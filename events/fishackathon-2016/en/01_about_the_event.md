## 🌍 International context
The **Fishackathon** is a global initiative led by the U.S. Department of State to foster the development of technological solutions to issues related to sustainable fishing and the protection of marine ecosystems.  
The event is held simultaneously in different cities worldwide, connecting participants with technical, scientific, creative, and business backgrounds to work intensively on real-world challenges over a single weekend.

## 🎯 Purpose
The 2016 edition in Medellín aimed to produce functional prototypes and innovative proposals that would:
- Reduce overfishing.
- Improve the traceability of fishing supply chains.
- Strengthen sustainable management of marine resources.

## 🏛 Medellín venue
The **National University of Colombia – Medellín Campus** was chosen as host thanks to its infrastructure, track record in innovation events, and commitment to sustainability.  
The event took place in academic spaces adapted for collaborative work, with high-capacity connectivity and constant technical support.

## 🙋‍♀️ My perspective as coordinator
Taking on the role of **General Coordinator** meant leading an event that, beyond technological development, required creating an environment that encouraged interdisciplinary collaboration and creativity under time pressure.  
From the first contact with international organizers to the closing awards ceremony, my job was to ensure that every detail —logistics, partnerships, communications, technical program, and participant support— was perfectly aligned with the global vision of the Fishackathon.
