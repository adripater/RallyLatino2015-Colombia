## Personal Note from Adriana

I am currently studying Software Engineering at UniversitÃ© Laval. It has been an enormous challenge, starting with the fact that I had to learn French. Before, I knew GitHub existed, but I thought it was only for programmers and that you could only use it if you knew how to code. I eventually realized I could use it to document my process, to showcase (and remind myself) what I am capable of.  

The Latin American Innovation Rally in 2015 was one of two projects I led during my time at the CD+I of the Faculty of Mines (in other projects, I was part of the team without leading them). It is worth noting that I was finishing my masterâ€™s degree at the same time and that in 2013 I was a national taekwondo champion (a national tournament, not the National Games). My goal-oriented mindset was essential, as was my vision of focusing on how to make something happen rather than on why it might not.  

Suddenly, I found myself talking to other universities to coordinate efforts and ensure that Colombia had representation in this Rally. I fondly remember the conversations with Miguel from Argentina. It was a collaborative effort that felt like second nature to me, and I truly enjoyed discovering that about myself.  

Of course, none of it would have been possible without the incredible team around me: Professor AndrÃ©s, who trusted me (I still donâ€™t know what he saw in me, to be honest); Alejandro, a marketing and communications genius who already knew the university bureaucracy very well, which was fundamental; Jader, who had been working there longer and whose experience was invaluable; and finally Milady, who at the time was a student intern, always delivering impeccable work, unafraid to speak up, to share ideas, and ready to take on any task the project required, consistently delivering quality.  

Kudos to the volunteer team and to everyone at Universidad Nacional. Without them, none of this would have been possible.
