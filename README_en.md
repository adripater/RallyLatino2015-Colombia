## What is the Latin American Innovation Rally?
The Latin American Innovation Rally is an international team competition that promotes open innovation among university students across Latin America. It takes place simultaneously in all participating countries, lasting 28 consecutive hours, where teams must address real-world challenges proposed by companies, NGOs, or other public and private organizations ([rallydeinnovacion.org](https://www.rallydeinnovacion.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## How it came to Colombia
The Latin American Innovation Rally was first brought to Colombia by the **Center for Development and Innovation (CD+I)** of the Faculty of Mines at the National University of Colombia, under the direction of **Professor Andrés Osorio** and the **general coordination of the Medellín campus by Adriana María Paternina Páez**.  

The **Bogotá Campus** participated as an associated venue, with the presence of **Professor Rafael** as guest judge, which enriched the evaluation process and strengthened the connection between campuses. This collaboration allowed the Rally to be held in two campuses of the National University and fostered joint work with the **University of Antioquia** and the **Metropolitan Technological Institute (ITM)** to consolidate the first edition in Colombia.
