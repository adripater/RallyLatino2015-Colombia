# Cooperation for Innovation in Colombian Firms: A Longitudinal Social Network Analysis Using EDIT Surveys (2010–2012)

## Overview
This research analyzed cooperation networks among Colombian firms using data from the **6th National Survey on Technological Development and Innovation (EDIT VI)**, which covered the period **2010–2012**. The study applied **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** techniques to identify patterns, central actors, and structural properties of innovation cooperation.

## Objectives
- Map the structure of cooperation networks across sectors.  
- Identify key actors and their roles in fostering innovation.  
- Compare different cooperation types (R&D, technology transfer, marketing of innovations, etc.).  
- Evaluate the potential of network analysis as a policy tool for innovation management.

## Methodology
- **Data preparation:** Cleaned and coded raw data from EDIT VI into adjacency and attribute matrices using **Excel**.  
- **Network construction:** Built **valued** and **binary** matrices representing cooperation ties between firms and sectors.  
- **Software:** Imported datasets into **UCINET 6** for network calculations and **NetDraw** for visualization.  
- **Indicators computed:**
  - Density and normalized density.
  - Degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centralities.
  - Core/periphery structure.
  - Bipartite network projections (actor–actor, sector–sector).  
- **Visualization:** Produced static graphs and tables summarizing results by sector and cooperation type.

## Key Findings
- The network exhibited **low overall density**, indicating limited cross-sector cooperation.  
- A small group of actors concentrated the highest centrality scores, acting as **knowledge brokers**.  
- Public research institutions and universities played a pivotal role in connecting otherwise isolated firms.  
- Cooperation in R&D was the most central type of collaboration in the network structure.

## Skills & Tools Used
- **Social Network Analysis**: Network modeling, centrality measures, density analysis.  
- **Data Management**: Data cleaning, coding, and matrix construction in Excel.  
- **Software**: UCINET 6, NetDraw.  
- **Analytical Skills**: Interpretation of network metrics, policy-oriented analysis.  
- **Visualization**: Network diagrams, tables, and summaries for academic reporting.

## Potential Applications
- Benchmarking cooperation levels across industries.  
- Identifying strategic actors for innovation policy interventions.  
- Designing programs to strengthen network connectivity.
