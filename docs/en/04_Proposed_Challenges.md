## Notes
- The challenges come from the Rally's international challenge database, available at [rallydeinnovacion.org](https://www.rallydeinnovacion.org).  
- There was no assignment of challenges: each team could choose the one they were most interested in or in which they considered they could provide the strongest solution.  
- Solutions were evaluated by local and national judges according to the competition's criteria.
