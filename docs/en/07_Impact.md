# Impact

The 2015 Latin American Innovation Rally at the Medellín campus of the National University of Colombia generated significant local and international impact, showcasing **Adriana María Paternina Páez’s** ability to coordinate real-time hybrid events long before this practice became mainstream in the post-pandemic era.

## Local impact
