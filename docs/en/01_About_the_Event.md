# About the Event

## What is the Latin American Innovation Rally?
The Latin American Innovation Rally is an international team competition that promotes open innovation among university students across Latin America.  
It takes place simultaneously in all participating countries, lasting 28 consecutive hours, during which teams must respond to real-world challenges proposed by companies, NGOs, or other public or private organizations.

## International organization
The Rally is coordinated by an **international executive committee** composed of:
- **ACOFI** (Colombian Association of Engineering Faculties) – Colombia  
- **CONFEDI** (Federal Council of Engineering Deans) – Argentina  
- **ANFEI** (National Association of Engineering Faculties and Schools) – Mexico  

These organizations work alongside national coordinators in each country to plan, manage, and evaluate the event.  
In Colombia, **ACOFI** acted as the national coordinator and also served as a national judge, evaluating projects and ensuring a high-quality winner selection process.

## How it came to Colombia and the Medellín Campus organization
The Latin American Innovation Rally was brought to Colombia for the first time thanks to **ACOFI's** efforts and the support of universities nationwide.

The **Medellín Campus** organized its edition under the **general coordination of Adriana María Paternina Páez**, with the direction of **Professor Andrés Fernando Osorio Arias** and the joint work of the **Innovation and Development Center (CD+I)** execution team:
- Alejandro Martín Naranjo  
- Jader Rengifo David  
- Milady Aguilera Cardona  

In addition to leading the logistics in Medellín, **Adriana Paternina** played an active role in **communicating and coordinating with other participating universities in Colombia and with the international committee**, ensuring criteria alignment, quick problem-solving, and a constant flow of information before and during the event.

## A hybrid and internationally connected event in 2015
Although the Rally was held in person, it integrated **hybrid work and international collaboration elements** that are common today but, in 2015, represented a technological and logistical innovation.  
During the 28-hour competition, real-time connections were established with other countries’ venues, enabling:
- Exchange of progress and results.  
- Live broadcasts for the opening and closing ceremonies.  
- Coordinated evaluations with judges in different locations.  

This setup, supported by technological infrastructure and coordinated management, anticipated the remote work and virtual collaboration culture that became widespread years later during the pandemic.
